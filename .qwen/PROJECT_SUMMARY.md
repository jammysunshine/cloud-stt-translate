# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a real-time voice translation web application using Next.js that captures user audio, performs cloud-based Speech-to-Text and language detection, and translates the transcribed text into multiple target languages (English and Arabic).

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js (React), WebSocket server, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API, Google Cloud Translation API
- **Architecture**: Frontend (Next.js) communicates with a separate WebSocket server for real-time audio processing
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Winston for server-side logging, custom clientLogger for frontend logging
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses dotenv for environment variables, centralized configuration in appConfig.js
- **Quality Standards**: Must follow rigorous testing approach including unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security tests before any commits

## Recent Actions
- **Fixed Critical Runtime Errors**: Resolved WebSocket server syntax errors and Next.js frontend Babel configuration issues
- **Enhanced Auto-Testing Suite**: Expanded from basic unit tests to comprehensive coverage including:
  - Backend server startup validation
  - Frontend server startup validation  
  - Browser connectivity end-to-end testing
- **Implemented Auto-Running Scripts**: Added npm scripts for continuous testing (watch modes)
- **Created Configuration Compliance**: Established .qwen.md file mandating strict adherence to docs/gemini.md guidelines
- **Added Puppeteer E2E Testing**: Implemented browser automation testing to catch runtime errors that only occur when browsers connect to the frontend

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Fix WebSocket server syntax and runtime errors
2. [DONE] Fix Next.js frontend startup errors  
3. [DONE] Expand auto-testing to catch backend/frontend runtime errors
4. [DONE] Implement auto-running test suite with watch capabilities
5. [DONE] Establish configuration compliance with project guidelines
6. [DONE] Add end-to-end browser connectivity testing
7. [TODO] Continue implementing core voice translation features per prompt.md specifications
8. [TODO] Maintain comprehensive test coverage as new features are added
