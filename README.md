This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Environment Variables

This project requires certain environment variables to be set for the Google Cloud services and the WebSocket server to function correctly.

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/google-cloud-keyfile.json"
WS_PORT=3001
```

*   **`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`**: This should be the absolute path to your Google Cloud service account key file (JSON format). This file is used by the Google Cloud client libraries to authenticate your application.
*   **`WS_PORT`**: This specifies the port on which the WebSocket server will listen. The default value is `3001`. Ensure this port is open and not in use by other applications.
