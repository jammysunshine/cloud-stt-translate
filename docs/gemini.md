This is a file created by Gemini.

After every logical step or feature implementation (e.g., after implementing a new function, or fixing a bug, or completing a set of related changes), I will automatically commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository.

For the overall project goals and requirements, refer to `prompt.md`.

**Important Note:** This `gemini.md` file, along with `README.md` and `Prompt.md`, must be reviewed and updated automatically after any significant change to the project to ensure all documentation remains current and accurate.

**Code Maintenance:** Regularly check for and remove unused code (imports, variables, functions, dead code) to maintain a clean and efficient codebase. This should be done frequently and automatically if possible.
