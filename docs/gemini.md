**Important Note:** This `gemini.md` file, along with `README.md` and `Prompt.md`, must be reviewed and updated automatically after any significant change to the project to ensure all documentation remains current and accurate.

**Code Maintenance:** Regularly review the code for issues, optimizations, and unused parts (imports, variables, functions, dead code) to maintain a clean, efficient, and high-quality codebase. This should be done frequently and automatically if possible.
